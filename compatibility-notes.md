##Compatibility Issues

- we're running on Ubuntu 16.04 which is not compatible with Elastic Beanstalk
- this version of AWS CLI is compatible with python3.5: awscli 1.11.31 Make sure you have a workinng installation of AWS CLI before you attempt an CodeDeploy work
- i ran into issues with Locust on a machine running ubuntu 16.04. not clear if Anaconda was involved or python3. didn't dig for answers once i go it running
